# Protein Sequence Matching using Dynamic Programming and Hidden Markov Models

This Jupyter Notebook presents some implementations for Dynamic Programming algorithms for solving the task of protein sequence matching.

Algorithms explored:
- Needleman-Wunsch sequence matching
- Smith-Waterman partial sequence matching
- Viterbi Algorithm 

TODO:
- [ ] Better Data Visualisation
- [ ] Description of each algorithm
